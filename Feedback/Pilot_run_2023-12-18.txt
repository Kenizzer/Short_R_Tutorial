# One up
- Liked how the workshop started from the very basics
- Learned a ton; exponentially increased my knowledge and comfortability with the program.
- It was nice to be able to learn how to organize and use data in a different program aside from Excel. I feel like learning how to make the graphs and how to work with them was the best part of this course.


# One down
- Some of the dplyr functions need to be explained a little more clearly
- A lot of information in one day
- We were given so much information during this course. This made it a bit hard to remember exactly everything we just learned. Maybe split the course up into two days.

# General/additional thoughts
- I would maybe split this workshop into two separate days. It was a lot to learn in 6 hours. Splitting it up might make future people retain the skills more that they learned in this course.
